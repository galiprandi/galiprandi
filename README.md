<h1 align="left">Hey ðŸ‘‹ What's up?</h1>

###

<p align="left">I'm GermÃ¡n Aliprandi, an Engineering Manager boasting over two decades of experience in the dynamic realm of IT. I'm deeply passionate about steering technology teams toward excellence, as I believe it's where I can truly make an impact in software development. While leadership is my focus, I've never lost my love for codingâ€”it's a constant source of joy for me. I relish the opportunity to explore and master new tools and technologies, ensuring I stay at the cutting edge of innovation.</p>

<p align="left">Even though my focus is on leadership, I have never stopped coding because I simply love doing it. I enjoy learning and experimenting with new tools and technologies, and I hope to never stop doing so.</p>

<p align="left">Thank you for visiting my profile, and please feel free to send me a message if you wish.</p>

<p align="left">
ðŸ“š Learning: Currently, I am primarily studying Fastify and how it creates highly scalable, high-performance backends in TypeScript, as well as Qwik, which I consider the most disruptive frontend framework of the moment. In addition to this, I never stop reading newsletters about leadership and agile methodologies.

<p align="left">
ðŸŽ¯ Goal: My professional goal is to build and improve the best possible software product and work environment. On a personal level, my goal is to build the happiest family in the world.
</p>
<p align="left">
ðŸŽ² Fun: I enjoy doing some sports, mainly paddle tennis, riding a bike, and above all, spending time with my children. Nothing more.
</p>
<p align="left">ðŸ’» Project: Currently, I'm pouring my energy into<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@galiprandi/react-tools">@galiprandi/react-tools</a>, a library aimed at simplifying and enhancing React development. It's a labor of love that I'm excited to share with the community!</p>

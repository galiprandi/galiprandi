# Hi, how are you ?  ðŸ‘‹

### I am from Argentina, owner of a small shop of photogarphy equipments called [Gadget](https://micamara.ga/), but  now and I am evaluating the possibility of relocating to another country, mainly to Australia.

### Programming has always been my passion and my principal hobby, so I keep up to date with the latest tools and good frontend development practices. I love create code simple and powerful.

### I've been development websites for more than 20 years as a hobby, and now I'm determined to dedicate myself professionally to it, which is what I love make.

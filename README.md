# Hi, how are you ?  ðŸ‘‹

### I am from Argentina, currently I live in TucumÃ¡n and I have a small business called [Gadget](https://micamara.ga/) in which we sell and repair photographic equipment.

### Besides I am passionate about programming, especially Frontend technologies and I usually try some technologies that I find interesting. Lately I'm playing with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and Python.
